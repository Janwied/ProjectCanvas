# ADR 1: TypeScript as a programming language

## Status

accepted

## Context

Our client MaibornWolff requires the Desktop-App (Project Canvas) and the Backend (Project Extender) to be written in TypeScript.

## Decision

We will write the Desktop-App and the Backend in TypeScript.

## Consequences

- One language for everything. Makes development easier between the packages.
- Type safety everywhere.
- We could have used a different more performant language for the backend (Rust) but at the cost of simplicity.
