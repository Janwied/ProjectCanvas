# ADR 2: Electron as the desktop wrapper

## Status

accepted

## Context

Our client MaibornWolff requires the Desktop-App (Project Canvas) to be developed with **Electron** or **nwjs**.

## Decision

We will develop the Desktop-App with Electron. Because it has a bigger community (100K Stars on GitHub vs. 40K for nwjs) and it has more features like automatic updates and tools for the creation of installers.

## Consequences

- Better support through the active community.
- Faster development thanks to the bigger toolset.
