# ADR 3: React as a UI Framework

## Status

accepted

## Context

Our client MaibornWolff requires the Desktop-App (Project Canvas) to be developed with either **React**, **Vue**, or **Svelte**.

## Decision

We will choose React because the team has more experience with it and has the biggest community.

## Consequences

- Finding developers that know React is more likely.
- Pass out on new features that are used in newer framworks e.g. no virtual dom manipulation in Svelte.
