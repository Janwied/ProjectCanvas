# ADR 4: Mantine UI as a CSS Framework

## Status

accepted

## Context

Our client MaibornWolff suggests the use of TailwindCSS or Bootstrap for the CSS Framework. Internally we suggested the use of [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/)

## Decision

We will choose Mantine UI because the team has more experience with it and is regularly updated. It provides a lot of components to start with.

## Consequences

- Faster UI development because we don't have to build everything from the ground up.
- Better looking UI out of the box.
- Has a slight learning curve to it.
