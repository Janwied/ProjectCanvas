# ADR 5: Fastify as the server framework

## Status

accepted

## Context

Our client MaibornWolff requires the Backend (Project Extender) to be developed with [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/).

## Decision

We will use Fastify to develop the Backend because it is highly performant, TypeScript ready and a customer requirement.

## Consequences

- Better responsiveness under load.
- Low cost of infrastructure.
