# ADR 6: PostgreSQL as the database

## Status

accepted

## Context

Our client MaibornWolff requires PostgreSQL or MySQL for the database.

## Decision

We will use PostgreSQL for the database as the team has more experience with it. It is also a feature-rich database that can handle complex queries and massive databases.

## Consequences

- Ability to store all kinds of data and relations we might need.
