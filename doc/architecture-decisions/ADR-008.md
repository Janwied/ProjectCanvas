# ADR 8: Babel for transpiling JS(TS)

## Status

accepted

## Context

Project Canvas which uses Electron needs to "include/import" Project Extender to function as a backend. However in it's current implementation Project Extender is written in ES6 and is not supported by Electron.

## Decision

Use Babel to transpile TypeScript files of Project Extender into vanilla JavaScript.

## Consequences

The release and building pipeline becomes more complex. But this presents a neat solution for the end user as the backend and frontend is packed together.
