# ADR 9: Yarn for package management

## Status

accepted

## Context

We need to use a dependency manager to install and manage the dependencies.

## Decision

There is a choice between npm, yarn and pnpm. We will use Yarn as the the team has experience with it.

## Consequences

Yarn is a pretty fast and smart dependency manager so downloads will be faster. For the moment, no noticeable downsides.
